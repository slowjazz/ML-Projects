# openAIGym
This folder holds different approaches to some OpenAI environments to primarily introduce me to reinforcement and deep learning algorithm design. The `cart_tensorflow.py` program borrows heavily from a tutorial series by [sentdex on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) In the future I hope to experiment with using recurrent neural nets as effective reinforcement learning models. 

# Neural Net Projects
This folder contains everything else about experimenting with neural nets, including small feed-forward implementations and a personal project on bus ticket colors.

### Ticket colors EDA
A work-in-progress EDA notebook on the patterns of daily bus ticket colors.

# General ML
Folder containing general ML stuff- like EDA's or model comparisons on various datasets. 

### Framingham Heart Study feature extraction/engineering
My final project for a data science class at school- This primarily compares accuracy of SVM and Random Forest on the dataset in R. Also, some data imputation and feature extraction with Random Forest is explored using MICE and randomForest. The models ended up being nothing too special, with ~80% cross-validated accuracies.
