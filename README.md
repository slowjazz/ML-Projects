# openAIGym
This folder holds different approaches to some OpenAI environments to primarily introduce me to reinforcement and deep learning algorithm design. The `cart_tensorflow.py` program borrows heavily from a tutorial series by [sentdex on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) In the future I hope to experiment with using recurrent neural nets as effective reinforcement learning models. 

# Neural Net Projects
This folder contains everything else about experimenting with neural nets, including small feed-forward implementations and a personal project on bus ticket colors.

## Ticket colors EDA
A work-in-progress EDA notebook on the patterns of daily bus ticket colors.
